# P2P_LAMDEN

## Lamden contract for a peer to peer betting protocol

Contracts and test suite were completed. I wrote the tests before I knew what pytest fixtures were so atm you have to run everyone individually, if u add an isolate function it should be cool.
p2p_contract.py is the test compatible version of the contract.
p2p_contract_func.py is the mainnet/testnet compatible version of the contract.

I started making changes to deal with masternode api rate limits, i'm pretty sure I concluded that, but I may have forgotten if I finished that part or not, in any case, if I didn't conclude it, there will be very minor things to change (look for commmented code).

Feel free to use however you want, you can credit me if you want, otherwise, no biggie.

Have fun!
